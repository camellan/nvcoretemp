nvcoretemp is a very simple command-line utility I wrote because I
wanted an IRC bot to report the core temperature of my NVIDIA graphics
card by capturing some command's output.

It uses libxnvctrl to query the NV_CTRL_GPU_CORE_TEMPERATURE attribute
for the current X display given in DISPLAY, or :0 as a fallback.

There are no command line options besides --batch (or -b, for short),
which limits the output to just the temperature value and a newline.
Errors are written to stderr.

To build it, you will obviously need X11 (Xlib) and libxnvctrl. To run
it, you will need an X display running NVIDIA's proprietary stack.
